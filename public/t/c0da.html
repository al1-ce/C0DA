Our lord is High Alma Jaroon, of House Jaroon, whose city is the First City of the New North, where all who Went Under from Landfall settled and made peace with the Worm, when we were not Eighty and One separate peoples but One, carrying the tibrols on our backs together and cutting tunnels by the light and heat that all mer wore, with equal dust in every mouth. My family's name comes from the first child born in the Velothiid, Haeko-dol-Sul, and, like him, we are salt merchants. Our crest is the tusk of the bat-tiger. Our bloodline is registered by `C0DA`.\n\u003e\n\u003e The Digitals say we come from another star, but so many have forgotten. I have not, for my lineage granted me audience with Memory, and I have spoken with the Wheels of Lull.

Though many Above have renounced Memory, they too remember.\n\n----\n\n# PAGES 2-3\n\n## **DOUBLE-PAGE SPLASH WITH INSET:** VELOTHIID LANDSCAPE.\n\n### **Description**: We're beneath the surface of the moon, in a connected series of mighty caverns. A great city sprawls across it all-- ghettoes cut into the rock, marketplaces gathered by every silvery lake, quartz-and-ruby temples rising up and out to protect the various tunnels that lead into and out of the caverns. Color washes up everywhere: red lamps, cultivated farms of glowing lichen and moss, and the signal lights of drifting sload-bag transports and vigilant wasp-riders. Throngs of hooded citizens huddle everywhere, occasionally holding up the palanquins of silk-laden merchants. Mechanical servitors float about, their torsos leaving trails of blue-white mathematical symbols.\n\n### This civilization stretches even across the ceilings, with gigantic stalactites serving as the houses of the nobility, dotted with lit windows and crest-banners, sporting pictures of strange beasts and Daedric scripture.\n\n\u003e # TEXT UPPER LEFT\n\u003e\n\u003e Present day.

A small torch floats close to him. There is an archway on the terrace that leads to a dimly-lit room.\n\n\u003e # JUBAL-LUN-SUL (V.O.)\n\u003e\n\u003e That's a lie. I want more that just that. I want a very great thing for the whole of my people. Call it a messiah complex, if you must.

It's in their agenda.\n\n## **PIC 3:** INT.

Reaching from the ceiling are multi-jointed \"telescopes\" that we can assume lead up and out onto the lunar surface.\n\n\u003e # JUBAL-LUN-SUL (V.O.)\n\u003e\n\u003e They made these tunnels at first. Then we got here and did the rest. But we're not supposed to be here at all. At least that's what I keep telling myself.  \n\n\u003e # JUBAL-LUN-SUL (V.O.)\n\u003e\n\u003e See, the thing about the Worm is that they can't go Up. But we can. We do. Make that: some of us do, the ones that are allowed.\n\n## **PIC 4:** INT. HOUSE SUL UNDER-MANOR - EAST OBSERVATORY\n\n### Jubal stands before one the mirrors, lost in thought. Nearly indiscernible is a massive tunnel, a red lamp illuminating only a small portion of it.\n\n\u003e # JUBAL-LUN-SUL (V.O.)\n\u003e\n\u003e **Everyone** is allowed during **every** Landfall Season. Most of us decide not to, since it's more dangerous Up there than it is down here. But I **had** to go.\n\n\u003e # JUBAL-LUN-SUL (V.O.)\n\u003e\n\u003e I come from a very, very old family. The oldest families. The **progenitors.** One with **bells on,** too, I might add. The \"first child born Under\" and all of that. In other words, we've got **history.**\n\n\u003e # JUBAL-LUN-SUL (V.O.)\n\u003e\n\u003e If I hadn't gone? The Digitals would've stuck their fingers into things. No one wants that. No one.
