I was drunk, so I cannot describe the courier, but I can verify that it is, indeed, from the Fifth Era (!) of Tamriel from an author unknown to me, even in visions.\n\n## It will be of interest to many lore scholars here; indeed, since it concerns Vivec's \"Scripture of Love\" it was very much of interest to me.\n\n## Enjoy.\n\n----\n\n\u003e Ald Sotha Below, 5E911\n\u003e\n\u003e House Sul Progenitor House, duly noted under the digital house,\n\u003e\n\u003e Whirling School Prefect Approved\n\u003e\n\u003e Chronocule Delivery: souljewel count: 78888-00-00-00-000\n\nMy name is Jubal-lun-Sul, of House Sul, whose name is known and heard throughout the Scathing Bay and the Nine times Nine Thrones. Our lord is High Alma Jaroon, of House Jaroon, whose city is the First City of the New North, where all who Went Under from Landfall settled and made peace with the Worm, when we were not Eighty and One separate peoples but One, carrying the tibrols on our back together and cutting tunnels by the light and heat that all mer wore, with equal dust in every mouth. My family's name comes from the first child born in the Velothiid, Haeko-dol-Sul, and, like him, we are salt merchants. Our crest is the tusk of the bat-tiger. Our bloodline is registered by `C0DA`.\n\nThe Digitals say we come from another star, but so many have forgotten. I have not, for my lineage granted me audience with Memory, and I have spoken with the Wheels of Lull. I have seen proof, as any who come Up during Landfall Season, when the winds die down enough Above that all may make pilgrimage under the banner of Vehk and Vehk. Though many Above have renounced Memory, they too remember.\n\n----\n\nI tell you now, brothers and sisters of the coming 4th, that the holy Scripture of Love contains all you need to avoid the perils of the Landfall. By chronocules granted by the â€˜neers of Lull, this warning is given freely and by Love. Sermon 35 begins properly:\n\n### \"The formulas of proper Velothi magic continue in ancient tradition, but that virility is dead, by which I mean at least replaced. Truth owes its medicinal nature to the establishment of the myth of justice. Its curative properties it likewise owes to the concept of sacrifice. Princes, chiefs, and angels all subscribe to the same notion. This is a view primarily based on a prolific abolition of an implied profanity, seen in ceremonies, knife fighting, hunting, and the exploration of the poetic. On the ritual of occasions, which comes to us from the days of the cave glow, I can say nothing more than to loosen your equation of moods to lunar currency.\"\n\nThe C0DA broke when Twice Vehk appeared again from Aether, but they captured enough of Him to render the words stable again. In this passage, He describes the goal of the Lunar God, who some of you still ascribe the name \"Lorkhan\". When stabilized, the words become proof:\n\nAll creation is subgradient. First was Void, which became split by AE. Anu and Padomay came next and with their first brush came the Aurbis.\n\n----\n\n## Void to Aurbis: naught to pattern.\n\n### \"Later, and by that I mean much, much later, my reign will be seen as an act of the highest love, which is a return from the astral destiny and the marriages between. By that I mean the catastrophes, which will come from all five corners. Subsequent are the revisions, differentiated between hope and the distraught, situations that are only required by the periodic death of the immutable. Cosmic time is repeated: I wrote of this in an earlier life. An imitation of submersion is love's premonition, its folly into the underworld, by which I mean the day you will read about outside of yourself in an age of gold. For on that day, which is a shadow of the sacrificial concept, all history is obliged to see me for what you are: in love with evil.\"\n\nThe marriages of the Aether describe the birth of all magic. Like a pregnant **[untranslatable], **the Aurbis exploded with its surplus. Will formed and, with it, the Potential to Action. This is the advent of the first Digitals: mantellian, mnemolia, the aetherial realm of the etada. The Head of this order is Magnus, but he is not its Ward, for even he was subcreated by the birth of Akatosh.\n\n----\n\n## Aurbis to Aetherius: possibility to maintenance by time.\n\n### \"To keep one's powers intact at such a stage is to allow for the existence of what can only be called a continual spirit. Make of your love a defense against the horizon. Pure existence is only granted to the holy, which comes in a myriad of forms, half of them frightening and the other half divided into equal parts purposeless and assured. Late is the lover that comes to this by any other walking way than the fifth, which is the number of the limit of this world. The lover is the highest country and a series of beliefs. He is the sacred city bereft of a double. The uncultivated land of monsters is the rule. This is clearly attested by ANU and his double, which love knows never really happened.\"\n\nLull calls this a refutation of sorts, but the wise may know it as the first appearance of Nu-Mantia, which is Liberty. Rather, the road to Liberty.\n\nAnother subcreation happened to the wheels of the etada, a shore that all of creation crashed against, the terminus of limits known as Oblivion. An echo of the Void before but unalike, many spirits fled here and came to power by merely harnessing the impossibility of Limit%2BAll.\n\n----\n\n## Aetherius to Oblivion: creation to destruction.\n\n### \"Similarly, all the other symbols of absolute reality are ancient ideas ready for their graves, or at least the essence of such. This scripture is directly ordered by the codes of Mephala, the origin of sex and murder, defeated only by those who take up those ideas without my intervention. The religious elite is not a tendency or a correlation. They are dogma complemented by the influence of the untrustworthy sea and the governance of the stars, dominated at the center by the sword, which is nothing without a victim to cleave unto. This is the love of God and he would show you more: predatory but at the same time instrumental to the will of critical harvest, a scenario by which one becomes as he is, of male and female, the magic hermaphrodite.\"\n\nWe begin to see the first inkling of emergence, which by its nature requires the merging of two-fold powers. Inevitably, this leads to another gradient, but this time by forceful process: the Trap of the Lunar God. The Aedra are Named at this time, having lent their hands to what was to be the arena of the eternally impossible: Mundus, or Exactness.\n\n----\n\n## Oblivion to Mundus: debris of all possibility to anchor of all things.\n\n### \"Mark the norms of violence and it barely registers, suspended as it is by treaties written between the original spirits.\"\n\nWhen one visits Memory, you become filled with the first ideas of the Lunar God, and see the trap within the trap. Vehk knows it at this point, and sees for all of you, and realizes the need for treaty: avenue of escape, first stone.\n\nC0DA translation: if all previous gradients continue along this path, especially given that there is now a centerpoint, impossible Mundus, the process of continuation can be pre-figured.\n\nThe echo of the Void is Oblivion. The echo of Oblivion is now mortal death. Death results in reappropriation of spirit towards its aligned AE -- either to the god-planet Aedra or the Principalities of Oblivion. Vehk's name for this transaction, mentioned above, is \"lunar currency\".\n\n**AE CHIM NU-MEN NU-MANTIA**\n\n----\n\n## Mundus to Mortal Death: centerpoint to the soon recycled.\n\n### \"This should be seen as an opportunity, and in no way tedious, though some will give up for it is easier to kiss the lover than become one.\"\n\nHere we come to the Scripture's greatest resignation: to imagine the subcreation AFTER mortal death, which by pattern would mean an echo of Mundus, and through this imagining, the failures of so many.\n\nThe Digitals' record of the Lunar God's involvement in all of this is called the Great Pain: *\"The Lunar God failed by his own devices, to show the new progeny how they might not.\"*\n\nYou in the Fourth Era have already witnessed many of the attempts at reaching the final subgradient of all AE, that state that exists beyond mortal death. The Numidium. The Endeavor. The Prolix Tower. CHIM. The Enantiomorph. The Scarab that Transforms into the New Man.\n\nSimply put, as the Gods cannot know joy as mortals, their creation, so mortals may only understand the joy of Liberty by becoming the progenitors of the models that can make the jump past mortal death.\n\n*And so many of you give up.*\n\n----\n\n### Mortal Death to Z (Z being the state-gradient echo of Mundus Centerex): antinymic to **[untranslatable].**\n\n### \"The lower regions crawl with these souls, caves of shallow treasures, meeting in places to testify by way of extension, when love is only satisfied by a considerable (incalculable) effort.\"\n\nThose who do not fail become the New Men: an individual beyond all AE, unerased and all-being. Jumping beyond the last bridge of all existence is the Last Existence, The Eternal I.\n\n**I AM.**\n\n**A whole World of You.**\n\n**God.**\n\nGod outside of all else but his own free consciousness, hallucinating for eternity and falling into love: *I AM AND I ARE ALL WE.*\n\nC0DA Digitals have confirmed that a subject in sensory deprivation begins to hallucinate after only twenty minutes. Scale unto this along the magical spectrum and maintenance of time, which is forever, and you begin to see the Lunar God's failure as Greatest Gift. As above, *\"This is the love of God.\"*\n\nWhy Love?\n\nKnow Love to avoid the Landfall, my brothers and sisters of the past.\n\nThe New Man becomes God becomes *Amaranth,* everlasting hypnogogic. Hallucinations become lucid under His eye and therefore, like all parents of their children, the Amaranth cherishes and adores all that is come from Him.\n\nI ARE ALL WE.\n\n*God is Love.*\n\nCOME TO THE HOUSE OF WE.\n\n*God is Love.*\n\nONE WORLD IN SPIRIT I AM.\n\n*God is Love.*\n\n----\n\n### And that is how the message ended. Do with it what you will and freely discuss. I know what I am doing with it, but then, I've been trying and trying for years. \"Considerable effort\", indeed.\n\n### And perhaps it is no accident that this falls on 9/11. Love to its Memory. And my love to Kurt Kuhlmann, whose birthday was destroyed by the will of critical harvest.\n\n### -MK"
